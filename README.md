# Financial-Management-Application
The application is used to hold client information and display it in a small website. 

This website would display the information of each of the accounts in the system including their basic information, transaction history, the stocks they own and if they made a profit or loss. This program would display the accounts in decending order from the the account with the highest to the lowest value.
